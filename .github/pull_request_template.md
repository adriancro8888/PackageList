There's a bug in Xcode 12 beta 3 that is affecting this repository's validation script. Unfortunately, validation for your pull request *will* fail due to this bug.

If possible, please run validation locally with Xcode 12 beta 1 or 2. If that's not possible, don't worry. Just submit your pull request, and one of the repository administrators will run validation for you.
